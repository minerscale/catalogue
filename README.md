Don't know where to start? Here are some of my favorites:

1. Clarinet Quartet
2. Dance of the Drunken Draugr
3. You've got mail!
4. Rondo in A. (fun story I wrote this piece in pure C (the programming language), and the output of the program is the music's waveform! anyway huge missed oppurtunity to put it in the key of C)
5. Autunm Arson. I wrote this for a game and I think it's II V Is are charming.

All the other pieces are good too in my opinion. Have a gander!
